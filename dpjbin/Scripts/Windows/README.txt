Windows-Related DPJ Scripts
===========================

This directory contains some scripts to enable DPJ to work (more or less) 
under Windows, using Cygwin to get a Unix-like environment.  These scripts
act as wrappers for java and javac, translating path names in command lines 
between Cygwin and Windows styles.

To install DPJ on Windows, do the following:

1. Install the JDK.

2. Install Cygwin (from cygwin.com). In addition to the default installation, 
be sure to install the "perl", "make", and "unzip" packages.  Use a Cygwin 
shell for the remaining steps.

3. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK, e.g. 
export JAVA_HOME="\"/cygdrive/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0_05\""

4. Do the DPJ user installation as described in the Installation Manual.

5. Add the directory $DPJ_ROOT/Scripts/Windows to the beginning of your PATH.
